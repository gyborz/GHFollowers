GitHub Followers iOS app project.

This project was a course project from Sean Allen: https://seanallen.teachable.com/p/take-home

The goal of this course was to learn more about how to write clean code, how to abstract and group the written code,
how to make it more readable, and how to develop iOS apps completely programmatically, without the use of storyboards.

The app was written in Swift using UIKit and SafariServices. There were no third party libraries involved in this project.

In the app the user can search for someone's github username and get all of their followers. Here the user can tap on a 
follower to view some of their github information.

Here the user can get this follower's followers or check out it's whole github profile.
The user can also save the searched github user to favourites.
